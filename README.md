# NoSilkS
 KiCAD 8.0 default footprints with all graphical silk screen elements removed

Graphical silkscreen elements can throw DRC errors and interfere with exporting production files if they intersect with other elements. Most of the time, they are completely unneeded. If the polarisation or pin 1 of a component needs to be marked, this can easily be done by modifying one of the pads to look different than the others, for example using rounded square vs. regular square pads vs. circular pads.

The files were modifyied using a Windows PowerShell script.
